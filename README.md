# WebApp-GroceryList

This project is a web application that I had created for CS 415 - Design of Database Systems in Northeastern Illinois University.

This web app is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) type of app. The front-end is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end is made with PHP code that used SQL commands to perform CRUD operations on a database with a single table that was made in phpMyAdmin.

This web app allows its user to create a list of grocery items. The list's items can be sorted either by Item Name (alphabetically ascending or decending), Item Type (alphabetically ascending or decending), Price (numerically ascending or decending), or Quantity (numerically ascending or decending). Another feature of this web app is that it can calculate the items' subtotal (price before adding-in sales tax), the cost of the sales tax by inserted sales tax percentage, and the total (the subtotal plus the cost of the sales tax).

You can watch a YouTube video demonstration of this web app at this link:
